The Entire Process (Simplified format):

Imagine you're asking your friend (the DNS server) for directions to their house (google.com). Your friend tells you the address (IP address). You then travel to that address (connect to the web server). Your friend might need some time to prepare (process the request). Finally, your friend opens the door and shows you their house (sends the response with the webpage content). Your brain interprets the layout and decorations (renders the webpage).

This is a simplified explanation, but it captures the essence of what happens when you type a URL and press Enter. It's a complex dance between your browser, DNS servers, and web servers to deliver the content you see on your screen.
