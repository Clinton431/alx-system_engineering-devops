What is an Incident Postmortem?
A postmortem (or post-mortem) is a process intended to help you learn from past incidents. It typically involves an analysis or discussion soon after an event has taken place.

Postmortems typically involve blame-free analysis and discussion soon after an incident or event has taken place. An artifact is produced that includes a detailed description of exactly what went wrong in order to cause the incident, along with a list of steps to take in order to prevent a similar incident from occurring again in the future. An analysis of how your incident response process itself worked during the incident should also be included in the discussion. The value of postmortems comes from helping institutionalize a culture of continuous improvement. This way, teams are better prepared when another incident inevitably occurs with mission- or business-critical systems.
Why Do Postmortems?
During incident response, the team is 100% focused on restoring service. They should not be wasting time and mental energy thinking about how to do something optimally or performing a deep dive on what caused the incident. Doing this could further delay remediation efforts and convolute the resolution process. That’s why postmortems are essential—they provide a peacetime opportunity to reflect once the issue is no longer impacting users. The postmortem process drives focus, instills a culture of learning, and identifies opportunities for improvement that otherwise would be lost.
