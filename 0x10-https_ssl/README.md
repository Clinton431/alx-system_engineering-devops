HTTPS and SSL work together to create a secure connection on the web. Here's a breakdown of each:

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):

Protocol: HTTPS is a secure version of the standard HTTP protocol used for communication between web browsers and servers.
Function: HTTPS adds a layer of security to HTTP by encrypting the data being transmitted. This encryption protects sensitive information, like login credentials, credit card details, or private messages, from being intercepted by attackers.
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):

Technology: SSL is a cryptographic protocol that forms the foundation for HTTPS security. It's the technical engine that handles the encryption and decryption of data. While SSL is the historical term, the current standard is its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security). However, "SSL" is still commonly used to refer to the overall concept.
Handshake: When you visit a website secured with HTTPS, a complex handshake process occurs between your browser and the server. This handshake establishes a secure connection and exchanges encryption keys used to scramble and unscramble the data being transmitted.
How HTTPS with SSL Works:

Website Request: You enter a website address (URL) in your browser, and it initiates a connection to the web server.
HTTPS Negotiation: The browser requests a secure connection using HTTPS.
Server Certificate Transfer: The server sends its SSL certificate to the browser. This certificate contains information about the website's identity and a public encryption key.
Certificate Validation: The browser verifies the validity of the certificate by checking its issuer (a trusted Certificate Authority) and expiration date. If the certificate is valid, the browser trusts the connection.
Secure Key Exchange: The browser and server establish a secure session by generating a secret key using a combination of the server's public key and the browser's private key (generated for this session). This secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data exchanged between them.
Encrypted Communication: All data sent between your browser and the server is encrypted using the established secret key. This makes it unreadable to anyone who might intercept it.
Benefits of HTTPS with SSL:

Confidentiality: Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.
Data Integrity: Ensures that data is not tampered with during transmission.
Authentication: Verifies the identity of the website you're communicating with.
Finding Secure Websites:

Look for the padlock icon and "HTTPS" in the address bar of your browser when visiting websites that deal with sensitive information. This indicates a secure connection established using HTTPS and SSL/TLS.
